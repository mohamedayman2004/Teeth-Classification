# 🦷 Teeth Classification — CNN Model

This project is part of my internship training, aiming to build a **robust computer vision model** to classify dental images into **7 distinct categories**.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- ✅ **Preprocessing:** Normalize, augment, and prepare dental images for training.
- ✅ **Visualization:** Understand the class distribution and display examples before & after augmentation.
- ✅ **Model Building:** Develop a custom **CNN architecture** using TensorFlow.
- ✅ **Baseline Training:** Train the model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate its performance.
- ✅ **Deployment Ready:** Store results & models for future improvement.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset is divided into:
- **Training**: 3087 images in 7 class folders.
- **Validation**: 1028 images in 7 class folders.
- **Testing**: 1028 images in 7 class folders.
